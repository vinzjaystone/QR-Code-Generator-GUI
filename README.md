# QR-Code-Generator
A simple program that generates a QR Code 

Data entry will differ based on what you wrote in the config file.

For example, if you only want to have a Name, Age, Gender as your input,
just write: 
{"entries": ["name", "age", "gender"]} then the script will generate Label/Entry dynamically.
The Window will automatically resized based on numbers of entry you wrote.

QRCode automatically saves in current directory with first entry as its filename.
